### Accessibility

Semantic HTML is used to aid people with dissabilities such as visual impairment and alternative text is used for all images so it can be read by screen readers. Semantic HTML also helps with search engine optimization so the right users can find this site and find it useful.<br>
All pages are designed to be responsive to different screen sizes to accommodate users with different preferred devices.

## Deployment
The project repository was created from the Code Institute template and then cloned to my computer using VS code. Changes were continuously pushed back up to Github for source control.<br>
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
- Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
