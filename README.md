### Meet Arnold!

### Code

- Inspiration from my own previous portfolio project: Strawberry lowers.

- Some of the code from the Love Maths walkthrough project was used and adapted.

- Re-watched these videos to make grid positioning work:
[Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=3s) and
[Why CSS grid-area is the best property for laying out content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duH4DLq5yoo)
