## Design

### Colours
In this website, the user can select their own colour theme. Everyone likes different colours and colours are persieved different on different screens. Having the choice to change the colour ensures that user can get maximum enjoyment out of this gaming experience.



### Typography

Chosen fonts for this website are Pixelify Sans for the main heading and Roboto for all other text. <br>
It is important that users initial reaction to the header is "this is silly" before they are introduced to the computer based opponent, Arnold. Combining the serious title of "Battle Arena" with the playful font achives this well. Other text are written as if spoken by Arnold. The font Roboto perfectly encapsulates Arnolds essence and sets the right tone.


### Images

Images used in this website are simple and playful to not disturb the colour theme.


### Wireframes

Initial wireframes sketch designs. The final design has many improvements from the initial ideas.

## Features


### The header

This header is displayed consistently throughout navigating the games pages. It was designed with the intent of making the users first initial reaction to be "This is a bit silly". An aggressively named title together with a playful font and icons achives this. It is important that the user has this mindset before meeting Arnold.

### Meet Arnold!

One of the main features of the webpage is the amusing computer based player, Arnold. He has a fun and sassy personality. He is over-confident in his abilities to win in this game and is a self proclaimed expert in everything. He is not a gracious winner and a very sore looser.
